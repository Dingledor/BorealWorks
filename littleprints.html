                            This was a project to create components which would allow
                            LittleBits circuitry toys to interface with the BluePrints
                            mechanical toy system created by Sphero. The goal was to
                            allow LittleBits motors and microcontrollers to drive contraptions
                            built with BluePrints parts.

                            This project came about during my time working at the technology
                            education non-profit PrairieSTEM after we met with representatives
                            from Sphero to discuss BluePrints, the new mechanical toy system
                            they were developing. I was very interested in BluePrints, as it
                            seemed like a flexible system for making intersting mechanisms.
                            For example, within a week I was able to create a functioning clock
                            with multiple hands using only the base BluePrints pieces.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I was very interested in adding motorization to the BluePrint
                            system. Our organization had previously taught lessons using
                            "LittleBits" citcuitry toys which were also property of Sphero.
                            The LittleBits system, in addition to having DC motors, provides
                            access to circuitry such as lights, light sensors, buttons, and
                            even programming through the "MicroBits" microcontroller. However,
                            there were many challenges in adapting the two systems to interface
                            with one another. First of all, BluePrints is based around a metric
                            system, with blocks being intervals of 25mm. In contrast, the grids
                            that hold the LittleBits elements are based on inches. This meant
                            that all of the parts created to connect the two systems would have
                            to account for this discrepancy. The axles used by the two systems
                            were also incongruous, thus an adapter would have to be designed to
                            allow the LittleBits motors to drive BluePrints gears.

                            I began by 3D printing a handful of test parts to find a way to
                            interface with the LittleBits system. The system uses a grid of
                            holes as a base with each circuitry component having small pegs
                            which friction-fit into the holes. I dialed in a design for my own
                            pegs which could be 3D printed, as well as finding proper hole
                            dimensions for my own printed parts. This was more complicated than
                            simply using calipers as the 3D printer cannot print perfect
                            tolerances from measurement.
